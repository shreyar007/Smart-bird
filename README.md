# Smart-bird

Genetic Algorithms and Reinforcement Learning are useful for finding solutions to prob-
lems for which there is no clear solution and the situations vary with time, i.e. for
probabilistic situations. In this project, we have implemented an AI for the Smart Bird
which makes the computer play the game much more efficient as compared to what a
normal human being can do. We have achieved these goals using Genetic Algorithms
with an underlying Neural Network Architecture.
